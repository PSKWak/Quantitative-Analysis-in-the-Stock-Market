# Quantitative-Analysis-in-the-Stock-Market
Quantitative Analysis in the stock market is a comprehensive financial methodology that harnesses mathematical and statistical techniques to examine stocks and financial markets. 
In this project, I have used descriptive analysis, time series analysis,volatility analysis, correlation analysis, and comparative analysis.

##1.Time Series Analysis: Time Series Analysis examines trends and patterns over time, focusing on the closing prices.
##2.Correlation Analysis: Correlation is used to examine how stock prices of different companies are related to each other.
##3.Comparative Analysis: Comparing the performance of different stocks.
##4. Descriptive Analysis: It provides summary statistics for each stock in the dataset. 
##5.Volatility Analysis: Calculate and compare the standard deviation of the closing prices for each stock. It gives insight into how much the stock prices fluctuated over the period.

The dataset contains the following columns for stock market data:

Ticker: The stock ticker symbol.
Date: The trading date.
Open: The opening price of the stock for the day.
High: The highest price of the stock during the day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock for the day.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, which accounts for all corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, etc.
Volume: The number of shares traded during the day.
